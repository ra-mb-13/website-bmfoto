  <p>
    I'm Bárbara Morais and I live in the North of Portugal.
    I'm a woman, wife, mother, and physician.
    I'm self-taught photographer, and a lover of alternative photographic processes.
    I photograph for pleasure, as a form of self-knowledge and  as a way to express my emotions. Occasionally, having availability, I also do some jobs that are asked of me.
    I exhibited my photographs at the Order of Physicians-Oporto and at the Eco Museu do Barroso.
    I won the first prize of photography of the Portuguese Association of General Clinic Physicians in 2015.
    In March of 2019, I had the honor of having collaborated and been interviewed by the magazine Spiral of Time, in its spring number, under the motto "green".
    In November 2021 I had the honor of being one of the guest artists who exhibited a work at the Zero Pixel Photography festival, which took place in Italy.
    In 2023 I had my first solo exhibitions, at the Order of Physicians - Porto and Order of Physicians - Regional Section of Vila Real.
    On the Flickr website since 2011, I has the invited artist by Contrasted gallery, in May 2023.
    My latest exhibition is now taking place at the Portuguese Center of Photography until June 1st!
    Come see what I do and  leave your opinion!!
    Thank you all!
